<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">Laptop</a> - small portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.
Most of the computer&#39;s internal hardware is in the lower part under the keyboard although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems which were originally developed for desktop computers. </p>

<h3 id="smaller-and-larger-laptops">Smaller and larger laptops</h3>
<p>There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included &quot;notebook&quot; and &quot;subnotebook&quot; models low cost &quot;netbooks&quot; and &quot;ultra-mobile PCs&quot; where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets and &quot;Desktop replacement&quot; laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware.</p>
<h3 id="convertible-hybrid-2-in-1">Convertible / hybrid / 2-in-1</h3>
<p>The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids convertibles and 2-in-1s emerged as crossover devices which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.</p>
<h3 id="rugged-laptop">Rugged laptop</h3>
<p>A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations extreme temperatures and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier heavier and much more expensive than regular laptops and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use. </p>
